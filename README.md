# PROWESS_GUI
Graphical User Interface for Testing Durability of Opto-Electronics

This GUI was used for running the experiments outlined in:

"Robust Electrothermal Switching of Optical Phase-Change Materials through Computer-Aided Adaptive Pulse Optimization" (2024) DOI 10.1002/pssr.202400177

The code base can be modified to support experiments involving a computer taking corrective action due to feedback from the system being tested.
